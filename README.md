# CSS Notes

Notes on reading [CSS: The Definitive Guide](http://amzn.eu/6m7B078)

## Chapter 1 - CSS and Documents
- `img`, `input` are _replaced_ elements; most are _nonreplaced_

### Display
- block elements: generate breaks before and after themselves; cannot appear within another element without disrupting it's display; `div`, `p`
- inline els do not generate breaks; `a`, `strong`, `em`
- in HTML, block elements cannot descend from inline elements
- list items are special cases of block elements - they generate the markers

### Stylesheets
- `link` els can have the `rel` attribute as `alternate stylesheet`
- alternate stylesheets should have a `title` attribute too; are grouped by title
- if given a title, a stylesheet is considered "preffered"; once an alt stylesheet is selected, it is not used at all
- alternate stylesheets supported by Gecko-based browsers, like Firefox
- can use media with `import`: `@import url(sheet1.css) projection, screen`
- can link stylesheets with the `Link` header; config is web-server dependend; FF/Opera

### CSS Rule Structure
- `<selector>: { <property>: <value>; }`
- each `<property>: <value>;` tuple constitutes a "declaration"
- in general, CSS is whitespace-insensitive
- comments are removed before parsing; do not count on them for whitespace

### Media Queries
- `media` attr of `link` element
- `media` attr of a `style` element
- `media` descriptor portion of an `@import` statement
- `media` descriptor portion of a @media declaration
- `<link href="a.css" media="print and (color), screen and (color-depth: 8)" rel="stylesheet" />`
- `@import url(print-color.css) print and (color), screen and (color-depth: 8);
- in the two exaples above, if _any_ of the queries evaluates to true, the stylesheet is applied
- can use `and` and `not`, but `not` can only be used in the begginning of a query
- `@import url(foo.css) only all` - not applied by browsers which do not understand MQ; applied otherwise
- the commas separating queries are acting as `or` statements
- all descriptors: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/all-descriptors.en.html
- `@supports (display: grid) { ... }` - applies if what is between parens is understood/supported
- `@supports not (display: grid)` - apply rules when something is _not_ understood
- `@supports (shape-outside: circle()) or (-webkit-shape-outside: circle()) { ... }`

## Chapter 7 - Basic Visual Formatting
- each element generates a rectangular box - the _element box_
- each element box has a _content area_ at its center
- each content area is surrounded by optional padding, border, outline and margin
  - in the absence of "surroundings": content area ≡ element box
- background is applied within padding and also to border gaps (e.g. - when dashed)
- margins are transparent - so the bg of _parent_ el. can be seen through them
- by default, border colour is same as the content foreground colour (if text is blue, border is also blue)
- https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/box.html#box-dimensions

### Normal Flow
- assuming Western, left-to-right locale, elements "flow" from top to bottom and left to right
- elements can be taken out of the normal flow by floating, positioning or becoming flexbox/grid

### Block Box
- the element box generated by elements like `div`, `p`, headings, etc is a _block_ box
- other elements can be made to generate block boxes with `display: box`
- generates line breaks before and after - each block box takes up a separate line (in normal flow)
- so boxes stack vertically

### Inline Box
- generated by elements like `strong` and `span`
- do not generate line breaks before or after themselves
- other elements can be made to generate inline boxes with `display: inline`

### Inline-block Box
- behaves like an inline block box externally (no line-breaks before/after) and block box internally

### Other
- non-replaced element - content is contained within the document
- replaced element - essentially, is a placeholder - `img`, `input`, etc
- root element - the `html` element

### Containing Block
- is the "layout context" for boxes inside it
- for any given box, the _containing block_ forms at the edge of the content area of the nearest ancestor that generated a block-like box (so, block elements like `div`, but also list items and table-related boxes)
- https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visudet.html#containing-block-details
  - has more info - covers abs. positioned, floated, etc

### Initial Containing Block
- https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visudet.html#containing-block-details
- it's size is the viewport size - not influenced by content

### `display`
- `inline` elements cannot contain `block` elements - that is not valid HTML, but browsers generally still allow it
- `display` can be used to alter how an element is _displayed_, but its inherent nature is not changed - so even if changing the `display` of an `inline` element (like `span`) to `block`, that will only affect how it is displayed; it (the `span`) still remains an `inline` element and should not contain any `block` elements.

### Box Model
- https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/box.html
- describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for HTML elements
- from center: content area → padding → border → margin

## Chapter 12 - Flexible Box Layout
- spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/
- box model: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/#box-model
- can alter order; but screen readers still read in source order (for now, at least)
- flex containers can be block or inline
- `display: flex` == `display: flex block`
- `display: flex inline` == `display: inline-flex`
- **only immediate children are _flexed_**
- flexbox is intended for single-dimensional content distribution, not grid-like layouts
- by default, non-fitting items don't wrap; they shrink if allowed by `flex` prop, and/or overflow
- `flex-wrap` - controls whether the flex container is limited to being single-line
- `flex-flow` - combines `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`

### Distribution Inside the Flex Container
- `justify-content`: _items_ in a flex line, along **main** axis; `flex-start/end`, `space-between/around/evenly`, `center`
- [`align-items`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/#align-items-property): _items_ along the **cross** axis of **each flex line**; `stretch`, `flex-start/end`, `center`, `baseline`
- [`align-self`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/#align-items-property): override `alight-items` for particular items; values available are the same (`stretch`, ...) but default is `auto`
- [`align-content`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/#align-content-property): _lines_ along the **cross** axis of the flex container; **`stretch`**, `start`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`
- if a flex item has an explicit dimension set, it is not "stretchable"
- the stretched dimension includes the margin
- the "stretch budget" is distributed equally among the items, regardless of their relative sizes
- text nodes get wrapped in an anonymous flex item
- whitespace is removed
- `float` is ignored
- `position: absolute` - takes the element out of flow
- `min-width` is `auto` for flex items; for most other elements, it is `0`

### Flexing
- `flex`: shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`; default: `0 1 auto`
- flex items will not shrink to less than border, padding and margins combined
- shorthand is strongly recommended over sub-properties
- `width` or `height` is ignored - whichever corresponds to the main axis; even with `!important`
- percentages are valid values only for `flex-basis` and are relative to element's parent's inner main-axis size
- **shrinking is also proportional to the width**; growing is not
- when both `width` and `flex-basis`, `flex-basis` wins in determining width
- `flex basis` - when percent, it is relative to flex container's size
